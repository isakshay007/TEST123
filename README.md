#Autonomous Tagging System for StackOverflow

ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Autonomous Tagging System aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of StackOverflowâ€™s tagging process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. By analyzing both question descriptions and code snippets, our model predicts relevant tags automatically, reducing errors and improving discoverability.

ðŸš€ Features
Text & Code Analysis: Uses NLP techniques to extract key topics from question titles/descriptions and analyzes code snippets for relevant concepts.
Tag Prediction: Predicts and ranks suggested tags with confidence scores.
User Feedback Integration: Learns from user corrections to refine future predictions.
Comparative Model Analysis: Implements and compares different approaches:
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Machine Learning Classifier

ðŸ”§ Setup & Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autonomous-tagging.git

cd autonomous-tagging


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the initial model:
python src/main.py


ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
We will compare the models based on: Accuracy of predicted tags vs. ground truth.
Precision, Recall, F1-score for classification performance.
Speed & Scalability of tag predictions.
